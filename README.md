# PC3D

### **Step 1: ML Learning + 3D Mesh Processing (First 2 Months)**
#### **Goal:**  
- **Understand the basics of ML/DL, 3D geometry, and point cloud processing**.
- **Implement a system that converts 3D meshes/point clouds into structured primitives (e.g., cylinders, cones, etc.).**

---

## **🟢 Phase 1: Learning ML Basics (Weeks 1-3)**
Before diving into NeRFs and SDFs, you need a **strong foundation in deep learning**. Since you’re already comfortable with programming, we’ll focus on fast, hands-on learning.

### **1️⃣ Learn PyTorch (for Deep Learning & NeRFs)**
💡 **Why?** PyTorch is the standard for deep learning and will be crucial when implementing your own NeRF-based system.

✅ **Resources**:
- **[Fast.ai’s Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/)** (*Best hands-on intro*)
- **[Deep Learning with PyTorch (Book)](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch)**
- **[Neural Networks from Scratch (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)** (*Excellent intro to neural networks*)

🔨 **Practical Exercises**:
- Install PyTorch (`pip install torch torchvision`)
- Implement a simple **feedforward neural network** using PyTorch.
- Train a **small model** on MNIST or CIFAR-10.

---

### **2️⃣ Get Comfortable with 3D Representations**
💡 **Why?** NeRFs and SDFs rely on **3D coordinate-based learning**, so understanding how 3D data is represented is essential.

✅ **Resources**:
- **[3D Math Primer for Graphics & Game Dev](https://gamemath.com/book.html)**
- **[3D Coordinate Systems (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl3xYAGD4Lo)** (Good intro)
- **[Mathematics for 3D Computer Graphics (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXtxFmWvQAg)**

🔨 **Practical Exercises**:
- Visualize 3D coordinate systems using **Matplotlib** or **Open3D**.
- Convert between **Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates**.

---

## **🟢 Phase 2: Learning 3D Mesh Processing & Point Cloud Manipulation (Weeks 4-6)**
### **3️⃣ Work with 3D Meshes and Point Clouds**
💡 **Why?** NeRFs don’t start with 3D meshes, but **point clouds and meshes are essential for geometry fitting**. You need to learn how to **convert, manipulate, and fit geometric primitives** to point clouds.

✅ **Libraries to Learn**:
- **Open3D** → Best for point cloud processing and visualization.
- **Trimesh** → Easy-to-use library for working with 3D meshes.
- **PCL (Point Cloud Library)** → More advanced, but useful if needed.

✅ **Resources**:
- **[Open3D Documentation & Tutorials](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/)**
- **[Trimesh Documentation](https://trimsh.org/)**
- **[Introduction to Point Cloud Processing (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z3-37wV-X4)**

🔨 **Practical Exercises**:
- Load a **.obj or .ply** file in **Open3D**.
- Convert a 3D mesh into a **point cloud**.
- Perform **basic transformations** (translation, rotation, scaling).
- **Segment a point cloud** using RANSAC (e.g., detecting planar surfaces).
  
📌 **Code Example (Load and Display a Point Cloud in Open3D)**:
```python
import open3d as o3d

# Load a 3D mesh
mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mug.obj")

# Convert mesh to point cloud
pcd = mesh.sample_points_poisson_disk(5000)

# Visualize
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])
```

---

### **4️⃣ Convert Point Clouds into Primitive Shapes**
💡 **Why?** You need to convert **raw point clouds into structured objects** (cylinders, spheres, etc.), which will later help in NeRF-based representations.

✅ **Resources**:
- **[Open3D RANSAC Tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/pipelines/ransac.html)**
- **[Primitive Shape Fitting (Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08006)**
- **[Point Cloud Shape Detection (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVkmXimM3A)**

🔨 **Practical Exercises**:
- Fit **cylinders, planes, and spheres** to point clouds.
- **Remove noise** from a raw point cloud.
- Detect **dominant surfaces** (e.g., walls, tabletops).

📌 **Code Example (Cylinder Fitting with RANSAC in Open3D)**:
```python
import numpy as np
import open3d as o3d

# Load a point cloud
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("point_cloud.ply")

# Fit a cylinder (RANSAC-based)
cylinder_model, inliers = pcd.segment_plane(distance_threshold=0.02,
                                            ransac_n=3,
                                            num_iterations=1000)

# Extract the fitted cylinder
inlier_cloud = pcd.select_by_index(inliers)

# Visualize
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([inlier_cloud])
```

## **🟢 Phase 3: Mini Project - Converting a Mesh into Primitives (Weeks 7-8)**
**Goal:** By the end of **Week 8**, you should be able to **take a 3D mesh or point cloud and break it down into simple 3D objects** (cylinders, planes, cones, etc.).

✅ **Final Mini Project Steps**:
1. **Load a mesh (.obj or .ply) and convert it to a point cloud.**
2. **Pre-process the point cloud** (remove noise, downsample).
3. **Segment the point cloud into components** (e.g., detect the body of a mug as a cylinder).
4. **Fit primitive shapes** (cylinders, cones, etc.).
5. **Export the structured representation.**

🔨 **Expected Output**:
- A program that takes a **3D mesh (e.g., a mug) and outputs a set of 3D objects** (e.g., a cylinder for the body, a torus for the handle).
- This will serve as the **input for the NeRF pipeline in the next phase**.
